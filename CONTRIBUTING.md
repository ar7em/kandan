### Get Involved
Since Kandan is a fully open-source app, we would appreciate if you dive in and start adding features, fixing bugs 
(what bugs?), and cleaning up the code.

But before you jump right in there there are a few caveats.

If you’re going to contribute code then you’re going to have to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](http://www.clahub.com/agreements/kandanapp/kandan) 
(hereafter referred to as CLA) which is modeled after the one that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) uses.

A CLA is a legal document in which you state you are entitled to contribute the code/documentation/translation 
to the project you’re contributing to and are willing to have it used in distributions and derivative works. This 
means that should there be any kind of legal issue in the future as to the origins and ownership of any particular 
piece of code, then that project has the necessary forms on file from the contributor(s) saying they were permitted 
to make this contribution.

The CLA also ensures that once you have provided a contribution, you cannot try to withdraw permission for its use at 
a later date. People and companies can therefore use that software, confident that they will not be asked to stop 
using pieces of the code at a later date.

You will also really want to take heart and read these two blog posts.
